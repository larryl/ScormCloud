INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

CONFIGURATION FOR TESTING

Running "make test" will prompt you for the values of your
ScormCloud AppID, SecretKey, and ServiceURL.  Those values will be
stored in a config file under blib/ (until you "make clean").  To
avoid the prompts, you can set:

    $ENV{SCORM_CLOUD_APPID}
    $ENV{SCORM_CLOUD_SECRETKEY}
    $ENV{SCORM_CLOUD_SERVICEURL}

You can set $ENV{SCORM_CLOUD_SERVICEURL} to the value "default" to
use the default ServiceURL (currently "http://cloud.scorm.com/api").

Note that these ENV values are only used for tests, you will need to
provide your own mechanism to supply them to the
WebService::ScormCloud->new() method (e.g. via ENV or config file).
